# Library Management System

## Project Overview

This is a console-based Library Management System developed in C++ using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. The project simulates core library operations such as book issuing, returning, member registration, fine calculation, and inventory management. It aims to demonstrate modular software design and practical use of file handling for persistent data storage.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete book records
- Register and manage members
- Issue and return books
- Calculate fines for late returns
- Maintain inventory of books
- Store and retrieve data using file handling (binary and text files)

## Technologies Used

- Programming Language: java
- Concepts Applied: 
  - Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, encapsulation, polymorphism)
  - File Handling (fstream, ifstream, ofstream)
- Platform: Console-based (terminal interface)

## OOP Concepts Implemented

- **Classes and Objects**: Defined for Books, Members, and Transactions
- **Inheritance**: Used to structure common behaviors
- **Encapsulation**: Data members are accessed via public methods
- **Polymorphism**: Implemented where appropriate for flexibility and extensibility

## File Handling

- All data is stored persistently using text or binary files
- File streams are used for reading and writing records
- Ensures that data remains consistent across sessions

## Folder Structure
